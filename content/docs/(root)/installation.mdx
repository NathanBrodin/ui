**Ready to build something that feels as fast as it looks? Let's get you set up.**

This isn't your typical component library installation. I've streamlined everything to get you from zero to building in under 5 minutes. No configuration hell, no decision paralysisâ€”just the essentials you need to start shipping.

<Steps>

1. **Start with a fresh Next.js app**
```bash
bunx --bun create-next-app@latest
```

2. **Clear out the Next.js defaults**
```bash
rm app/page.tsx app/favicon.ico && rm -rf public/*
```
Fresh slate. We're building something better than the default landing page anyway.

3. **Install shadcn/ui as the foundation**
```bash
bunx --bun shadcn@latest init --base-color neutral
```

4. **Add brodin/ui to your registry**

Update your `components.json` with my registry. This is where the magic happens:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://ui.shadcn.com/schema.json",
  "style": "new-york",
  "rsc": true,
  "tsx": true,
  "tailwind": {
    "config": "",
    "css": "app/globals.css",
    "baseColor": "neutral",
    "cssVariables": true,
    "prefix": ""
  },
  "iconLibrary": "lucide",
  "aliases": {
    "components": "@/components",
    "utils": "@/lib/utils",
    "ui": "@/components/ui",
    "lib": "@/lib",
    "hooks": "@/hooks"
  },
  "registries": {
    "@brodin-ui": "https://ui.brodin.dev/r/{name}.json"
  }
}
```

5. **Install the starter template**
```bash
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add @brodin-ui/app --yes --overwrite
```
This gives you a complete app structure that actually looks good out of the box. No more staring at unstyled components.

6. **Set up the typography**

Download these fonts and drop them in `/public/fonts/`:
- [iA Writer Quattro](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/raw/master/iA%20Writer%20Quattro/Variable/iAWriterQuattroV.ttf)
- [iA Writer Mono](https://github.com/iaolo/iA-Fonts/raw/master/iA%20Writer%20Mono/Variable/iAWriterMonoV.ttf)

> The shadcn CLI sometimes mangles font files during installation, so manual download is the reliable way.

7. **Pick your project logo**

Browse the [available logos](/docs/brand#logo) and click any one to copy its install command. Then:
- Run the install command
- Import your chosen logo in `app/icon.tsx` to replace the placeholder

Every logo has been hand-picked to work perfectly with this design system.

8. **Ship it**
```bash
bun dev
```

That's it. Your app is ready to build on.
