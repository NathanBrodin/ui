description: A personal component library built on top of shadcn/ui, designed to share consistent styles and components across my projects. Inspired by zed.dev, fully compatible with shadcn/ui.

**This is my fork of shadcn/ui, made to unify design and component logic across my projects.**

I've always loved the way [zed.dev](https://zed.dev) feels, fast, minimal, and focused. I wanted to bring that energy into my web projects, without reinventing the wheel each time. This is a personal collection of components, built on top of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com), with a design system that reflects my own taste and needs.

My goal is to:

- Share consistent **styles, themes, and UX patterns** across apps.
- Stay **fully compatible with shadcn/ui**, using the same CLI and registry system.
- Keep **component code open and accessible**, easy to read, tweak, and extend.
- Maintain **clean defaults** inspired by Zed’s aesthetic: sharp contrasts, subtle motion, and zero clutter.

This is not just a library to install, it’s a toolkit to help me move fast while keeping my UI consistent and expressive.

## Why fork shadcn/ui?

shadcn/ui already nailed a lot of what I wanted: open components, composable patterns, and a powerful CLI for distributing them. Instead of building something from scratch, I decided to build on top of it:

- I reuse the **shadcn/ui registry system** to distribute my components.
- The core architecture (Radix UI, Tailwind, etc.) remains intact.
- My focus is mainly on **styling, UX details, and organization**, making components feel more "me".

You can think of this as a theme-aware fork of shadcn/ui, adapted to my own ecosystem.

## Key principles

- **shadcn Compatible:** Use the same CLI, same schema, same workflows.
- **Consistent Design:** Styles are unified, inspired by [zed.dev](https://zed.dev), minimal, and expressive.
- **Open Code:** Like shadcn, every component is copied into your codebase so you can freely modify it.
- **Project Sharing:** I use this system across all my apps, whether personal tools, experiments, or production apps.
- **Framework-Friendly:** Works great with Next.js, TailwindCSS, and anything that integrates with the shadcn CLI.

You’re also free to fork this yourself, that’s the beauty of open code.
